aiobreaker
==========

aiobreaker is a Python implementation of the Circuit Breaker pattern,
described in Michael T. Nygard's book `Release It!`_.

Circuit breakers exist to allow one subsystem to fail without destroying
the entire system. This is done by wrapping dangerous operations
(typically integration points) with a component that can circumvent
calls when the system is not healthy.

This project is a fork of pybreaker_ by Daniel Fernandes Martins that
replaces tornado with native asyncio, originally so I could practice
packaging and learn about that shiny new ``typing`` package.

Features
--------

- Configurable list of excluded exceptions (e.g. business exceptions)
- Configurable failure threshold and reset timeout
- Support for several event listeners per circuit breaker
- Can guard generator functions
- Functions and properties for easy monitoring and management
- ``asyncio`` support
- Optional redis backing
- Synchronous and asynchronous event listeners

Requirements
------------

All you need is ``python 3.6`` or higher.

Installation
------------

To install, simply download from pypi:

.. code:: bash

    pip install aiobreaker

Usage
-----

The first step is to create an instance of ``CircuitBreaker`` for each
integration point you want to protect against.

.. code:: python

    from aiobreaker import CircuitBreaker

    # Used in database integration points
    db_breaker = CircuitBreaker(fail_max=5, reset_timeout=timedelta(seconds=60))

    @db_breaker
    async def outside_integration():
        """Hits the api"""
        ...

At that point, go ahead and get familiar with the documentation.
